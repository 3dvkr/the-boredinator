Feeling bored? Don't know what to do? Let The Boredinator inspire you to try new and fun activities. Find an activity by category or get a totally random activity, if you're feeling brave!

## Features

- Statemanagement with Redux

- CSS-only design, no CSS libraries

- Highly descriptive functions and commented code where necessary

## Open-source Contributions

I have opened a couple issues if you are interested in contributing the EASIEST and CHILLEST open source project in your life. Looking for more activity entries and a re-design of the category button grid, which currently does not fit the theme of the site.

I am open to any and all feedback. Thank you for checking out The Boredinator
