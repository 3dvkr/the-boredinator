## TO DO

[x] Lazy load images (is that even the correct term?). Basically, have a placeholder for images until fully rendered. I created a custom react hook but my "placeholder" image is the same for every imagef.

[] Lazy loader is there and working, BUT I want to somehow render a placeholder of the SAME image about to load. I don't know if that's possible. I can check this one off when I finally figure out how to lazy laod the SAME image and not a small, local image.

[] Re-design the grid of category buttons. They just don't fit the theme.

[] ADD A TON OF ACTIVITIES.

[] Create light/dark theme switch.
