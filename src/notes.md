## TO DO

[] Create light/dark theme switch.

[] Turn the index into collapsible/expandable components?

[] Incorporate icons for better looking interface?

[] ADD A TON OF ACTIVITIES.

[] Lazy loader is there and working, BUT I want to somehow render a placeholder of the SAME image about to load. I don't know if that's possible. I can check this one off when I finally figure out how to lazy laod the SAME image and not a small, local image.

[] An alternative is to use a skeleton image loader. 

## Complete

[x] Lazy load images (is that even the correct term?). Basically, have a placeholder for images until fully rendered. I created a custom react hook but my "placeholder" image is the same for every image.

[x] Re-design the grid of category buttons. They just don't fit the theme.

[x] Create an index/table of contents for ALL the activities, organized by category and probably alphabetized.
